## The Vision

You piece together ancient masks. Each fragment grants a unique ability, and combined masks unlock devastating elemental or mechanical synergies.
## Key Features

- Dynamic Mask Crafting: Mix and match top, bottom, and side fragments to create unique visual and mechanical combos.

- Pixel-Perfect Chaos: Hand-crafted pixel art with Godot’s high-performance 2D engine handling hundreds of on-screen entities.

- Fragment Synergies: Combining the Obsidian Eye with the Jagged Jaw might create a "Volcanic Bite" effect.
